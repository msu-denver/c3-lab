## Our Mission

The **Community-Centered Computing Lab (C3 Lab)** is a research lab in the [Department of Computer Sciences]({{ site.lab.department_url }}) at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Co-directed by Dr. Daniel Pittman and Dr. Ranjidha Rajan, the lab supports research and development projects that create technology for communities.

Our mission is to **design and deploy computing systems that empower communities** by improving access to information, strengthening decision-making, and enabling human-centered interaction with data and AI tools.

## Research Focus Areas

Our work spans several interconnected domains:

- **Human-Centered Computing** - Designing technology that puts users and communities first
- **Applied AI & Machine Learning** - Building practical AI systems that solve real problems
- **LLM-Driven Interfaces** - Creating natural language systems for accessible data interaction
- **Data Engineering** - Developing robust data platforms and pipelines
- **Geospatial Integration** - Incorporating location-based data and analysis
- **Accessible Design** - Ensuring technology is usable by diverse populations

## Current Initiatives

The lab's research portfolio includes three major initiatives:

### Colorado Sustainability Hub
A statewide sustainability-data platform funded by the National Science Foundation, integrating AI, geospatial systems, and natural language interaction to make Colorado's environmental data accessible to all.

### RILE Connect
A SIPA-funded statewide STEM ecosystem platform connecting K-12 schools, higher education institutions, nonprofits, and industry partners across Colorado to strengthen STEM education and workforce development.

### Roadrunner Connect
A student-built mobile and web application that enhances community engagement at MSU Denver, demonstrating our commitment to involving students in production software development.

## Student Opportunities

Students in the C3 Lab gain hands-on experience with:

- **Production Software Systems** - Work on real applications serving real users
- **Federal and State-Funded Research** - Contribute to externally-funded research projects
- **Modern Technology Stack** - Use current tools and frameworks
- **Community Impact** - Build platforms that directly benefit Colorado communities

We welcome students from Computer Science, Data Science and Machine Learning, and Computer Security programs who are interested in applied research with community impact.

## Department Affiliation

The C3 Lab is part of the [Department of Computer Sciences]({{ site.lab.department_url }}) at MSU Denver. The department offers three bachelor's degree programs:

- Computer Science (B.S.) - ABET Accredited
- Computer Security (B.S.)
- Data Science and Machine Learning (B.S.)

Our research complements the department's educational mission by providing students with opportunities to apply classroom learning to real-world projects.
