## About the Project

The Colorado Sustainability Hub is a statewide digital infrastructure initiative that consolidates sustainability and well-being data from across Colorado into a single, accessible platform. The project supports researchers, policymakers, and community members by making complex information easier to find, interpret, and use.

As a central initiative within the C3 Lab, the Sustainability Hub advances our mission to build community-centered data platforms that support accessible, evidence-informed decision making across Colorado.

## Bili: AI-Powered Sustainability Assistant

A key feature of the Sustainability Hub is **Bili**, an AI-powered chatbot that provides access to Colorado's publicly available economic, ecological, and social data related to environmental stewardship. Users can submit environmental queries to Bili, which uses large language models to provide research-backed answers about topics like climate impacts on Colorado.

### Technical Implementation

Bili is built using modern AI technologies:
- **Large Language Models** for natural language understanding
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate, sourced responses
- **BiliCore Framework** - our open-source evaluation tools
- **LangChain** for retrieval pipelines and tool interactions
- **LangGraph** for managing structured agent flows

## Platform Architecture

The Hub incorporates modern data engineering and AI technologies:

- **PostGIS-backed geospatial database** for location-based data
- **Metadata-rich data catalog** for data discovery
- **Cloud-based infrastructure** for data ingestion, storage, and access
- **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the web application
- **Accessibility-focused design** with responsive interfaces

## Funding Agency

The National Science Foundation is the primary federal agency that supports fundamental research and education in science, engineering, and computing. This project is funded under the **CISE-MSI Research Expansion Program**, which aims to broaden participation by increasing the number of CISE-funded research projects led by Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs).
