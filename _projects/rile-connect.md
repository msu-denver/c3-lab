## About the Project

RILE Connect is a statewide, open-source digital platform initiative designed to make the Colorado STEM ecosystem visible, navigable, and accessible. With grant support now awarded, the project is entering its initial implementation phase, focused on building shared digital infrastructure that will enable learners, educators, and partner organizations to discover opportunities and coordinate across sectors.

## Why Now?

Colorado is actively investing in digital transformation to modernize how public services, education, and workforce systems serve residents. As demand for STEM talent accelerates, educators and students are navigating rapid changes in technology, workforce expectations, and access to opportunity.

Beginning the digital transformation of the STEM ecosystem at this moment ensures that innovation is not limited to a few institutions or urban centers but connected through a shared statewide network that includes rural, frontier, and community-based organizations.

RILE Connect responds to this moment by initiating the development of a transparent, public-facing digital platform that will strengthen classroom-to-career pathways and ensure geography is no longer a barrier to participation in Colorado's STEM future.

## Beyond Higher Education

While RILE Connect is housed at Metropolitan State University of Denver, it is **not limited to higher education**. RILE Connect is intentionally designed as a lifelong STEM pathway platform, supporting learners and educators across career stages.

### Long-term Beneficiaries

- **K-12 students and educators** discovering STEM programs, mentors, and classroom-connected opportunities
- **Postsecondary students** accessing research, internships, and workforce-aligned learning experiences
- **Educators** seeking professional development, collaborators, and industry connections
- **Industry and workforce partners** connecting with future talent and education partners
- **Community organizations and nonprofits** expanding reach and collaboration

## SIPA Grant Impact

Receiving grant support from the Colorado Statewide Internet Portal Authority (SIPA) enables RILE Connect to move from planning and coordination into active development as a statewide, public-facing digital service.

With this grant, RILE Connect will be developed for statewide availability, serving communities across Colorado. While initial implementation focuses on Colorado, the platform is intentionally designed to scale and replicate, allowing other regions to adopt and adapt the system over time. Its open-source architecture supports long-term sustainability and positions RILE Connect for potential use beyond Colorado.

## Project Leadership

### Faculty Leadership

**Principal Investigator:**
- Dr. Ranjidha Rajan, Assistant Professor of Computer Science

**Co-Principal Investigators:**
- Dr. Daniel Pittman, Associate Professor of Computer Science
- Dr. Janelle Johnson, Professor in STEM Education

### Project Team

- **Undergraduate students** engaged in paid research and development roles (web, mobile, data, AI)
- **Educators and ecosystem partners** contributing to requirements, feedback, and opportunities
- **Industry and nonprofit collaborators** supporting mentorship and workforce alignment

Students are not just users—they are **co-builders**, gaining hands-on experience in civic technology, cloud systems, and applied AI while contributing to a platform designed to serve the public good.

## Design Principles

RILE Connect is guided from the outset by five core design principles that shape how the platform will be built and how it is intended to serve communities across Colorado:

1. **Transparency** - Open, visible systems and decision-making
2. **Trust** - Building confidence through reliable, secure infrastructure
3. **Accessibility** - Ensuring all users can participate regardless of ability or location
4. **Participation** - Enabling active engagement from all stakeholders
5. **Replicability** - Open-source, modular design that can be adapted by other regions
