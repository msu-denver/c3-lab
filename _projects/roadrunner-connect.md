## About the Project

Roadrunner Connect is MSU Denver's all-in-one mobile and web platform that transforms how students, faculty, staff, and visitors engage with campus life. Built by students, for the community, it unifies event discovery across the university — from academic seminars to athletic games and cultural festivals — into one intuitive, map-driven experience.

Whether you're looking to find a food truck on Tivoli Quad, attend a guest lecture, or cheer at a Roadrunners game, Roadrunner Connect makes it fun, easy, and rewarding.

## Strategic Alignment with MSU Denver 2030

Roadrunner Connect directly supports **Pillar III of the MSU Denver 2030 Strategic Plan**: *"Serve as an anchor institution by engaging with and contributing to the Denver community."*

By connecting students with on-campus opportunities and fostering meaningful engagement, the app strengthens MSU Denver's role as a hub of culture, learning, and connection — helping cultivate a vibrant and inclusive campus experience.

## Key Features

### Map-Based Discovery

### Integrated Calendar

### Event Check-Ins

## Get Involved. Get Rewarded.

With Roadrunner Connect, every step across campus is a chance to explore, connect, and win. Whether you're discovering new communities, competing in challenges, or just keeping up with what's happening, this app makes campus engagement both meaningful and fun.
