## About the Project

The Peer Support Hub is a unified digital platform that streamlines how faculty at MSU Denver request and manage peer support resources across the [Supplemental Instruction (SI)](https://www.msudenver.edu/student-academic-services/supplemental-instruction/), [Teaching Assistant (TA)](https://www.msudenver.edu/student-academic-services/teaching-assistant-program/), and [Learning Assistant (LA)](https://www.msudenver.edu/learning-assistant-program/) programs. By consolidating three separate application processes into a single system, the Hub simplifies participation for faculty while preserving the autonomy and distinct missions of each program.

The platform enables faculty to submit one application per course, select their preferred support types, and track decisions across all three programs. Program coordinators gain visibility into cross-program resource allocation, helping ensure equitable distribution of peer support across departments and courses.

## The Challenge

MSU Denver's peer support programs currently operate through separate application processes, timelines, and systems. Faculty navigating multiple forms submit duplicate information and lack a clear view of how support is distributed across their courses. Program staff face similar challenges due to the absence of shared data, and the university lacks a coordinated way to evaluate effectiveness or make data-informed decisions about resource allocation.

Some courses may receive multiple forms of support while others, including those with high enrollment or high DFW rates, may unintentionally receive none. This fragmented landscape creates challenges for planning, equity, and budget allocation.

## Project Goals

The Peer Support Hub is designed to support three key goals:

- **Transparency** - Faculty, staff, and leadership can view consistent, timely information about peer support availability, deadlines, and awards. The platform provides clearer visibility into how support is distributed across departments and courses.

- **Equity** - By providing a unified application process and coordinated data insights, the Hub helps align peer support resources with student and course needs. Program staff can make more informed decisions that reduce unintentional duplication and broaden access.

- **Coordination** - The Hub streamlines faculty-facing processes without altering the mission or decision-making authority of SI, TA, or LA programs. Each program retains full control over its review process, timeline, and eligibility criteria.

## Key Features

### Unified Application
Faculty complete one application per course rather than separate applications for each program. The application presents information about available support options based on course eligibility, and faculty can rank their preferences among selected programs.

### Program Autonomy
Each program retains full control over its criteria, timelines, training requirements, and decision authority. The Hub provides shared context rather than centralized control. Coordinators configure workflows that reflect their established practices.

### Cross-Program Visibility
Program staff gain access to course-level data showing where support has been requested or awarded across the institution. This reduces unintentional duplication and improves equitable distribution of resources.

### Coordinated Decision Routing
Applications route through programs based on configured eligibility rules and review windows. The system manages sequencing and timing automatically while preserving each program's established review practices.

## Implementation Timeline

**Spring 2026** - Planning and Prototyping
- Requirements refinement with SI, TA, LA, and department stakeholders
- Architecture design and workflow documentation
- Early interface prototypes and design review sessions
- Student developer onboarding

**Summer 2026** - Core Development
- Platform development including authentication, application workflows, and program dashboards
- Single sign-on and Banner data integration
- Internal testing and usability refinement

**Fall 2026** - Initial Rollout
- Pilot testing with program staff using real applications
- Peer Support Hub becomes available for SI, TA, and LA applications

## Student Involvement

The Peer Support Hub creates opportunities for hands-on learning in areas including:

- **Web Development** - Frontend and backend application development
- **UX Design** - Interface prototyping, usability testing, and accessibility auditing
- **Data Visualization** - Dashboard creation and analytics tools
- **Database Design** - Data modeling and system integration
- **Quality Assurance** - Testing and documentation

Student developers contribute to a platform designed to serve the university community while gaining practical experience in software development, civic technology, and applied computing.

## Relationship to C3 Lab

As a C3 Lab initiative, the Peer Support Hub demonstrates our commitment to:

- **Community-Centered** - Built to serve faculty, students, and program staff across MSU Denver
- **Student-Driven** - Students lead development efforts alongside faculty
- **Applied Research** - Real-world application of computing to improve university operations
- **Accessible Design** - Usable by diverse campus populations
